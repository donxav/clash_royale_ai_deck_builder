# Clash Royale AI Deck Builder

An **AI-powered deck builder for Clash Royale** that uses data pipelines, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and evolutionary algorithms to recommend competitive decks.  
This project is also structured as a **Data Science portfolio project**, demonstrating skills in data collection, preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and deployment.

---

## ðŸš€ Features (Planned)
- **Data Pipeline**: Fetch Clash Royale API data (cards, battle logs) and store it in structured datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze card usage, win rates, elixir distributions, and synergy scores.
- **Deck Optimization**: Use a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to generate high-performing decks.
- **Battle Simulator**: Rule-based engine to test deck performance.
- **Web Interface**: Dashboard for deck recommendations, statistics, and visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“… Roadmap (6 Months)
- **Month 1**: Python fundamentals, Clash Royale API integration, Pandas-based EDA.
- **Month 2**: Data pipeline automation, feature engineering, meta analysis.
- **Month 3**: Genetic Algorithm deck optimization.
- **Month 4**: Battle simulator & validation.
- **Month 5**: Web UI & performance improvements.
- **Month 6**: Advanced features, meta-awareness, deployment, final case study.

## âœ… Progress Tracker
| Week | Goal | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **Week 2** | Learn lists, dicts, functions, JSON. Create fake dataset & average elixir calculator. | â¬œ |
| **Week 3** | Fetch `/cards` from Clash Royale API. Save to CSV. Print card names & elixir. | â¬œ |
| **Week 4** | Fetch `/battlelog`. Learn Pandas basics. Analyze win rates & most used cards. | â¬œ |
| **Week 5** | Store API data in SQLite. Query card/match data. | â¬œ |
| **Week 6** | Automate daily API fetch. Avoid duplicates. | â¬œ |
| **Week 7** | Feature engineering: roles, synergy scores, elixir averages. | â¬œ |
| **Week 8** | Build early recommender: suggest top 3 decks from winning combos. | â¬œ |
| **Week 9** | Represent decks as GA chromosomes. Learn GA basics. | â¬œ |
| **Week 10** | Implement GA operators (mutation, crossover, selection). | â¬œ |
| **Week 11** | Fitness = synergy + meta win rate. Run GA. | â¬œ |
| **Week 12** | Add constraints (max elixir, must-have card). Save GA decks. | â¬œ |
| **Week 13** | Build simulator: troops, towers, elixir regen. | â¬œ |
| **Week 14** | Add movement, targeting, damage logic. | â¬œ |
| **Week 15** | Simple AI opponent (random plays). | â¬œ |
| **Week 16** | Integrate GA with simulator â†’ fitness from simulated matches. | â¬œ |
| **Week 17** | Backend API for recommendations (Flask/FastAPI). | â¬œ |
| **Week 18** | Build Streamlit/React UI for deck builder. | â¬œ |
| **Week 19** | Add charts: elixir curve, role coverage, win rate predictions. | â¬œ |
| **Week 20** | (Optional) Rewrite simulator in C++ for speed. | â¬œ |
| **Week 21** | Add recommendation filters (must-have card, archetype). | â¬œ |
| **Week 22** | Meta-awareness: counter most-used decks. | â¬œ |
| **Week 23** | Deploy app online. | â¬œ |
| **Week 24** | Final testing, docs, publish case study. | â¬œ |
